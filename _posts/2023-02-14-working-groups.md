Following the November workshop, we set out to define the minimum viable product that would deliver on the goals set out in the proposal document, and at the same time bound the development to a realistic goal for its first iteration. The MVP is intended to be a guide to deliver a viable notebook publishing solution that we can start from and expand upon. 

The five working groups and their Chairs are as follows:

**Pre-submission**
Rachel Kurchin
Steve Purves

**Metadata**
Kenton McHenry
Julia Wagemann

**Editorial and Peer Review**
Tony Castronova
James Munroe
Rae De Guzman

**Production and Post-Production**
Rowan Cockett
Brooks Hanson
Alberto Pepe

**Content Consumer**
Doug Schuster
Jeffrey Beck
Sam Teplitzky

The working groups convened beginning in February 2023. Using the MVP document as a guide, the working groups began answering the questions raised at the November workshop.
