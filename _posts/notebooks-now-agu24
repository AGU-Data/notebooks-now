Curvenote and AGU have launched a [showcase site](https://agu.curve.space/) ahead of AGU23! The site includes examples of notebooks (created from previously published notebook manuscripts (HUGE thanks to Kayla Iacovino and Lynne Elkins), instructions for creating and submitting notebooks (this resource is in the process of being built and is not complete in all aspects. Feedback for improvements or additional advice are welcome, see the contributing guide for instructions.)
AGU has published an [editorial](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EA003458) in Earth and Space Science to create more awareness and build excitement within the ESS community.
